        <p><em>What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? <br>
          Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? <br>
          Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</em></p>
        <p>I hope to achieve a firm understanding of the basics of website building and coding. <br>
          If I have the tools to troubleshoot issues and explore ideas so that I can further develop my skills after this class, I will be happy. <br>
          I want to feel confident in both creating structure for a site's content, and being able to customize it in unique ways. <br>
          I don't know that I would say this site gives me 'butterflies', but this artist's website is super fun and unique! Linked below.</p>
