            <p>I believe this is a Glossy Abelia Shrub, I am not sure. It is a humble shrub with little white flowers. These were planted all throughout the outdoor corridors at my highschool. Surely very few people ever noticed them, as they're not particularly interesting, but I did notice them from time to time. I noticed the trash that students lazily hid inside them. I noticed how after a year of being abused by these kids they started to look sad. They got smaller, less of their cute little flowers would bloom. Their soil was tainted by the endless stream of soda and instant ramen broth thrown into the dirt. I wonder how many students would remember these humble shrubs. </p>
