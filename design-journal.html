        <h2>WEEK 1</h2>
        <p><em>What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? <br>
          Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? <br>
          Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</em></p>
        <p>I hope to achieve a firm understanding of the basics of website building and coding. <br>
          If I have the tools to troubleshoot issues and explore ideas so that I can further develop my skills after this class, I will be happy. <br>
          I want to feel confident in both creating structure for a site's content, and being able to customize it in unique ways. <br>
          I don't know that I would say this site gives me 'butterflies', but this artist's website is super fun and unique! Linked below.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
        <p><em>What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? <br>
          How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? <br>
          How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</em></p>
        <p>I am planning to make a site where I am more concerned with the aesthetics than I am about the content. I am going to focus on a small <br>
          collection of subpar redscale film photos that I have of plants from southern california. The color palette of the site will come from <br>
          these monochromatic photos which are primarily red tones and dark greys. The type will have a lo-fi vibe similar to the photos, maybe a monospace, <br>
          sort of tech-looking one. I'm hoping to have the photos taking up most of each page. Each page will have different content about the plants. <br>
          Like, are they invasive? What is their purpose? Maybe I'll find a poem to pair with one of them. </p>

        <h2>WEEK 3</h2>
        <p><em>Imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. What do they spend their time on? <br>
          What are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv? Describe their personality.</em></p>
        <p>A high school student living in Southern California. They are learning to use a film a camera, they walk around everywhere with it. The camera they carry around allows
        them to notice and appreciate the mundane that surrounds them everyday. Having a series of photos from these mundane days allows them to see patterns.. to build collections of things.
        They dress simply, probably mostly black. They're always looking into new genres of music but have a few albums they love and will always go back to.
        They like simple, comforting meals. They're happy with a snacking dinner. They prefer reading an engaging book over watching tv but still loves the occasional movie night.
        They are down to earth and find comfort and intrigue in the little details of life.
