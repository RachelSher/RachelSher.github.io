    <p>
    This is a look into my teenage years through the plants that surrounded me growing up in Southern California. I took these photos 10 years ago, when I was 15 years old, using rescale film and an old hand-me-down film camera. I didnâ€™t think much of them back then. Now though, after living in Oregon for 6 years, they paint a picture of nostalgia. These photos remind me to look around and notice the mundane, the everyday things that make up the memories I will one day look back on.
