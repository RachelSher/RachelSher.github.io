    <h2>Part Four</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a sharp chef's knife or serrated knife to cut the log crosswise into 1/2" to 3/4" slices.</li>
        <li>Turn each biscotti onto it's side. </li>
        <li>Return the biscotti to the oven and <strong>bake for 40 minutes</strong>, or until they're starting to turn golden brown around the edges. <br>
            (They'll still feel quite soft in the middle but will crisp up as they cool in the oven.) </li>
        <li>Turn off the oven, crack the door open a couple of inches, and let the biscotti cool right in the oven.</li>
        <li>Biscotti will keep in an airtight container, at room temperature for several days.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ul>
