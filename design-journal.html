        <p><em>What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? <br>
          Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? <br>
          Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</em></p>
        <p>I hope to achieve a firm understanding of the basics of website building and coding. <br>
          If I have the tools to troubleshoot issues and explore ideas so that I can further develop my skills after this class, I will be happy. <br>
          I want to feel confident in both creating structure for a site's content, and being able to customize it in unique ways. <br>
          I don't know that I would say this site gives me 'butterflies', but this artist's website is super fun and unique! Linked below.</p>

        <p><em>What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? <br>
          How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? <br>
          How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</em></p>
        <p>I am planning to make a site where I am more concerned with the aesthetics than I am about the content. I am going to focus on a small <br>
          collection of subpar redscale film photos that I have of plants from southern california. The color palette of the site will come from <br>
          these monochromatic photos which are primarily red tones and dark greys. The type will have a lo-fi vibe similar to the photos, maybe a monospace, <br>
          sort of tech-looking one. I'm hoping to have the photos taking up most of each page. Each page will have different content about the plants. <br>
          Like, are they invasive? What is their purpose? Maybe I'll find a poem to pair with one of them. </p>
